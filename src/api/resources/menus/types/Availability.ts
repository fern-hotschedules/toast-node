/**
 * An `Availability` object with information about the days and times this menu is available. If the menu is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, this `Availability` object contains a single value, `alwaysAvailable`, that is set to TRUE. If the menu is not available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, the `alwaysAvailable` value is set to FALSE and the object will also contain a `schedule` value that provides detailed information about the specific days and times this menu is available. **Important_** The orders API does not validate against the availability settings of a menu, meaning it is possible to submit an order for an item on a menu when it is not currently available. For this reason, it is particularly important that you check a menuâ€™s `availability` value before placing an order from it.
