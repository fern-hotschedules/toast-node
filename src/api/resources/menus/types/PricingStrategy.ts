/**
 * A string that represents the pricing strategy used for this menu item. You use the `pricingStrategy` value, in conjunction with the `pricingRules` value, to calculate the price for a menu item that uses the Time Specific Price or Size Price pricing strategy. In the Toast administration back-end, menu items may have pricing strategies assigned to them individually, or they may inherit them from a parent menu group. The `pricingStrategy` value indicates the menu item's fully resolved pricing strategy. If the menu item is priced using the:
 *   * Base Price pricing strategy, then the `pricingStrategy` value is BASE_PRICE.
 *   * Menu Specific Price pricing strategy, then the `pricingStrategy` value is MENU_SPECIFIC_PRICE.
 *   * Time Specific Price pricing strategy, then the `pricingStrategy` value is TIME_SPECIFIC_PRICE.
 *   * Size Price pricing strategy, then the `pricingStrategy` value is SIZE_PRICE.
 *   * Open Price pricing strategy, then the `pricingStrategy` value is OPEN_PRICE.
 * If the menu item is priced using the Location Specific Price pricing strategy, then the `pricingStrategy` value indicates which pricing strategy is used at the current location. For example, consider a menu item that uses a menu-specific price at the Boston location and a base price at the New York location. When you retrieve the menu data for the Boston location, the `pricingStrategy` for the menu item is MENU_SPECIFIC_PRICE. When you retrieve menu data for the New York location, the `pricingStrategy` for the menu item is BASE_PRICE. If the menu item is priced using a price level, then the `pricingStrategy` value indicates which pricing strategy is used for that price level. For example, if the "Draft Beer" pricing level uses a time-specific price, then the `pricingStrategy` value for a menu item that is assigned the "Draft Beer" pricing level is TIME_SPECIFIC_PRICE. If the `pricingStrategy` value is BASE_PRICE or MENU_SPECIFIC_PRICE, you can retrieve the menu item's price from its `price` value. If the `pricingStrategy` value is TIME_SPECIFIC_PRICE or SIZE_PRICE, you must use the rules provided in _this menu item's_ `pricingRules` value to calculate the price for it.
