/**
 * A multi-use object that is used to: * Define when a menu is available. * Define when a time-specific price is available for a menu item or modifier option. A `Schedule` object defines a set of days of the week and a set of time ranges for those days. Days that have identical time ranges are grouped into a single `Schedule` object, for example, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, and FRIDAY in the example below have identical time ranges and are in the same `Schedule` object while SATURDAY and SUNDAY are in a separate `Schedule` object because their time ranges differ from the weekday time ranges. ``` "availability": {
 *   "alwaysAvailable": false,
 *   "schedule": [
 *     {
 *       "days": [
 *         "MONDAY",
 *         "TUESDAY",
 *         "WEDNESDAY",
 *         "THURSDAY"
 *       ],
 *       "timeRanges": [
 *         {
 *           "start": "09:00",

 *           "end": "23:00"
 *         }
 *       ]
 *     }
 *   ]
 * } ``` Time ranges are in 24-hour HH:MM format. If a day is not represented in the `Schedule` objects, the menu or time-specific price is not available on that day.
