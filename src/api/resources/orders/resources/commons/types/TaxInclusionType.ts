/**
 * Indicates whether the menu item price includes one or more tax
 * amounts. If the menu item is a modifier for another menu item
 * selection, it always inherits the tax inclusion behavior of the menu
 * item that it applies to.
 * Valid values:
 * * `INCLUDED` - The menu item price includes one or more tax amounts.
 * * `NOT_INCLUDED` - The menu item price does not include any tax
 *   amounts.
 * * `INHERITED` - The menu item is a modifier for another menu item
 *   selection in the check. The `taxInclusion` value of the parent menu
 *   item selection applies to the modifier. If a menu item selection
 *   *that is not a modifier* inherits tax inclusion behavior from a
 *   menu or menu group, the `taxInclusion` value is either
 *   `INCLUDED` or `NOT_INCLUDED`.
