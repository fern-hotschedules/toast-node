 * A `Selection` object can represent either a primary item (for example, `Check.selections`) or a modifier (`Selection.modifiers`) selection. Quantity defaults to `1`. For a `POST` operation, all selections must have valid `item` and `itemGroup` fields. The `item` and `itemGroup` values can be `null` for `GET` requests. For example, they are `null` for gift cards and on special requests. To specify a modifier selection, add it to the `modifiers` list of another selection. Each modifier selection must have its `optionGroup` field set correctly, because a `MenuItem` can be included in multiple `MenuOptionGroups`, potentially with different prices or sizing.
