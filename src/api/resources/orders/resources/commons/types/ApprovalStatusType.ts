/**
 * The current state of the order in the restaurant order
 * fulfillment process. For example, the `approvalStatus`
 * can indicate that an order is waiting for a restaurant
 * employee to approve it or that the order is in a
 * restaurant kitchen being fulfilled. Response only.
 * Valid values:
 * * `NEEDS_APPROVAL` - The order is created but will
 * not be fulfilled by the restaurant until an employee
 * approves it.
 * * `APPROVED` - The order is being fulfilled by the
 * restaurant or it was fulfilled in the past. Orders
 * remain in this state indefinitely after they are
 * fulfilled.
 * * `FUTURE` - The order is expected to be fulfilled by the
 * restaurant at a future date and time. Restaurant
 * employees will receive information about the order at the
 * date and time that it is ready to be fulfilled.
 * * `NOT_APPROVED` - Restaurant employees received
 * information about the order but did not approve it for
 * fulfillment. An order enters this state after a period of
 * time passes without a restaurant employee approving it.
